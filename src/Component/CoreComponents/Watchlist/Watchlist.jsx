      <p>B. psychology or physics.</p>
      <p>C. science, technology, engineering or mathematics.</p>

      <p className='my-5 font-bold'>22. The aim of Miyake’s study was to investigate</p>
      <p>A. what kind of women choose to study physics.</p>
      <p>B. a way of improving women’s performance in physics.</p>
      <p>C. whether fewer women than men study physics at college.</p>
